**This is the [latest](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/blob/master/features/README.md) version of our README.md. If you want to see the one of the last released version of "aruba", please have a look at this [one](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/blob/still/features/README.md).**

`aruba` is an extension for popular TDD and BDD frameworks like "Cucumber", "RSpec" and "Minitest" to make testing of commandline applications meaningful, easy and fun.

Your benefits:

* Test any command line application implemented in any [programming
  language](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/tree/master/features/getting_started/supported_programming_languages.feature) -
  e.g. Bash, Python, Ruby, Java, ...
* Manipulate the file system and the process environment with helpers working similar like tools you may know from your shell
* No worries about leaking state: The file system and the process environment will be reset between tests
* Support by a helpful and welcoming community &ndash; see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* The [documentation](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/tree/master/features/) is our contract with you. You can expect `aruba` to work as documented

Our Vision:

* Help our users to build better command line applications written in any programming language
* Make creating documentation for command line simple and fun
* Support the cucumber community in its effort to create a specification for all official cucumber implementations

Our Focus:
* Test the user-interaction with the commands at runtime &ndash; this excludes the process of installation/deployment of commands like installing Rubygems with `gem install <your-gem>`.

## Install

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

~~~ruby
gem 'aruba'
~~~

And then execute:

~~~bash
bundle
~~~

Or install it yourself as:

~~~bash
gem install aruba
~~~

## Usage

Please also see this
[feature test](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/tree/master/features/getting_started/supported_testing_frameworks.feature)
for the most up to date documentation.

### Initialize your project with "aruba"

There's an initializer to make it easier for you to getting started. If you
prefer to setup `aruba` yourself, please move on to the next section.

1. Go to your project's directory

2. Make sure, it's under version control and all changes are committed to your
   version control repository

3. Run one of the following commands depending on the tools you use to test your project.

   This assumes, that you use either `rspec`, `cucumber-ruby` or `minitest` to
   write the tests for your project. Besides that, your tool can be implemented
   in any programming language you like.

   ~~~bash
   aruba init --test-framework rspec
   aruba init --test-framework cucumber
   aruba init --test-framework minitest
   ~~~

### Your First Tests with "aruba"

1. Clone "Getting Started"-application

   ~~~bash
   git clone https://github.com/cli-testing/aruba-getting-started.git
   cd aruba-getting-started
   ~~~

#### Cucumber

1. Create a file named "features/support/env.rb" with:

   ~~~ruby
   require 'aruba/cucumber'
   ~~~

2. Create a file named "features/use_aruba_with_cucumber.feature" with:

   ~~~ruby
   Feature: Cucumber
     Scenario: First Run
       Given a file named "file.txt" with:
       """
       Hello, Aruba!
       """
       When I run `aruba-test-cli file.txt` 
       Then the file "file.txt" should contain:
       """
       Hello, Aruba!
       """
   ~~~

3. Run `cucumber`

   ~~~bash
   bundle exec cucumber
   ~~~

#### RSpec

1. Create a file named "spec/spec_helper.rb" with the following content. If the
   file already exists add the line to the file.

   ~~~ruby
   require 'aruba/rspec'
   ~~~

2. Create a file named "spec/use_aruba_with_rspec_spec.rb" with:

   ~~~ruby
   require 'spec_helper'

   RSpec.describe 'First Run', :type => :aruba do
     let(:file) { 'file.txt' }
     let(:content) { 'Hello, Aruba!' }

     before(:each) { write_file file, content }
     before(:each) { run_command('aruba-test-cli file.txt') }

     # Full string
     it { expect(last_command_started).to have_output content }

     # Substring
     it { expect(last_command_started).to have_output(/Hello/) }
   end
   ~~~

3. Run `rspec`

   ~~~bash
   bundle exec rspec
   ~~~

#### Minitest

1. Add a file named "test/test_helper.rb" with:

   ~~~ruby
   require 'aruba/api'
   ~~~

3. Add a file named "test/use_aruba_with_minitest.rb" with:

   ~~~ruby
   $LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path('../test', __FILE__)

   require 'test_helper'
   require 'minitest/autorun'

   class FirstRun < Minitest::Test
     include Aruba::Api

     def setup
       setup_aruba
     end

     def test_getting_started_with_aruba
       file = 'file.txt'
       content = 'Hello, Aruba!'

       write_file file, content

       run_command_and_stop 'aruba-test-cli file.txt'
       assert_equal last_command_started.output.chomp, content
     end
   end
   ~~~

4. Run your tests

   ~~~bash
   bundle exec ruby -Ilib:test test/use_aruba_with_minitest.rb
   ~~~
